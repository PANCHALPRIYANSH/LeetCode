# 🚀 LeetCode Journey — C++

This repository contains my **daily and consistent LeetCode practice** using **C++**.  
The goal is to strengthen **Data Structures & Algorithms**, improve problem-solving skills, and build strong coding habits.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Solve LeetCode problems **consistently**
- Master core **DSA patterns**
- Write **clean and optimized C++ code**
- Track long-term learning and progress

---

## 🛠️ Language & Tools
- **C++ (STL)**
- Compiler: `g++`
- Platform: **LeetCode**

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- **Start Date:** 29/01/2026
- **Consistency Goal:** Solve problems daily
- Difficulty order:
  - Easy → Medium → Hard

---

## 🧠 Practice Philosophy
- Start with a **brute-force** approach
- Optimize using the right **data structures**
- Focus on **time and space complexity**
- Revisit and improve difficult problems

---

## 📌 Notes
- Solutions are written independently
- Some problems may include **multiple approaches**
- Code is kept minimal, readable, and efficient

---

## 🤝 Learning & Doubts
Whenever I face difficulties, I analyze the problem deeply, revise concepts, and improve the solution.

---

## 💪 Commitment
> *Consistency beats motivation.*

This repository represents my continuous learning journey—progress over perfection.
